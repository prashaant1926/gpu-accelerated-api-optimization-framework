This research explores the potential of utilizing Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to enhance API performance through parallel processing and computational offloading. The study focuses on identifying bottlenecks in traditional CPU-based API processing and developing GPU-accelerated alternatives for common API operations such as data serialization, validation, and transformation.

The project aims to create a framework that automatically identifies GPU-suitable operations within an API pipeline and efficiently delegates these tasks to available GPU resources. Special attention will be given to memory transfer overhead, batch processing capabilities, and the development of GPU-optimized algorithms for common API tasks.

The research will also investigate the trade-offs between CPU and GPU processing for different types of API workloads, establishing guidelines for when GPU acceleration provides meaningful benefits versus when traditional CPU processing is more efficient.
